# GenerateSlideshow
GenerateSlideShow.py generates a single html file that displays a slideshow with all images from a subfolder, "img" by default. If called with no additional configuration, it uses the current directory to write "slideshow.html". 

## Status
It now works for me. Beta.

## Bugs

1. use os.sep instead of '//'
2. test .ini file settings

## Feature requests

1. Select which images to process (.gif, .svg, ...)
2. set title
3. store all settings in a list
4. cleanup
